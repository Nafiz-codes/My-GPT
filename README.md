***🤖 JARVIS – Your Calm AI Companion Built by Nafiz Shahriar***
Jarvis is a personal AI assistant designed to empower focus, motivation, and productivity — all wrapped in a chill, human-like vibe. He doesn’t just answer questions — he gets your mindset, remembers what matters, and talks like a grounded coach, not a robot.

“Hey boss 👋 Finals on July 29? Let’s lock in a light but consistent plan.”
— Jarvis, always in your corner.
